# react-hotloader-setup

This repo will show how to set up a project using:

* WebPack + Hot Module Replacement
* React 15.1 + Redux + React Router

It will grow as I set things up and I will try to comment as I do it so
that viewing the history of this repo will show what lines are added to
the various config files and why.
